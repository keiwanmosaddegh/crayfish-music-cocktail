# Crayfish Music Cocktail - a Spotify Ramp_Up 2020 Exploration Project

Based on ramp_Up 2020.

Initially we wanted to auto generate sound design for podcasts and audiobooks with SFX and Music. 
However, this is a big idea and after a lot of reading and testing with limited resources we ended up just creating a totally different, small and fun, app.

Our app - Tailored Cocktail, by the Crayfishes.
Where you we tailor your party with the songs you actually want to listen to.

Definitely not made with the purpose to be clean code. Only for fun!
